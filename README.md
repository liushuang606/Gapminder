# Gapminder

## 
Gapminder contains population, GDP per Capita and life expectancy for 142 countries in 5 continents from 1952 to 2007 in increments of 5 years. Part I of the project describes how development history unfold differently on different continents and in different countries over the 5 decades. Of particular interest is which countries were the leaders in this racing of development, and which countries strived in chasing the leaders. Part II of the project reveals the unusual dropping patterns and the relevant history. Many countries experienced growth in the 5 decades, while some countries encountered significant drops due to political events or diseases. Part III explores whether the leading digit in “naturally occurring numbers” (i.e., population and GDP per Capita) follows Benford’s law. Techniques used in part I and II are pipes, data manipulation and visualization. Part III employs Monte Carlo simulation.
